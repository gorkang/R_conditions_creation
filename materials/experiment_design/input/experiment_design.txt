Each participant saw two screening items composed of one PPV calculation item, willing to screen questions, comprehension questions, and a follow-up test problem. Both screening items were presented using one of six possible presentation formats, and one of two possible response types. The assignation of presentation format and response type to each participant was random. Each item was either a breast cancer or Down's syndrome problem. Also, the women presented in the problem was either 20 or 40 years old, with a normative PPV associated of 33 (low) or 66% (high), respectively. The presentation order of the problem context (breast cancer, Down's syndrome) and women's age (20, 40yo) was fully randomized. The follow-up problems had a procedure-related risk of 1 or 10% and were randomly combined with each screening item. After the screening items, participants had to answer a series of scales (for a detailed list of the scales see below). At the end participants had to answer a previous experience with breast cancer, mastectomy, Down's syndrome and abortion, a comments section, and some survey effort questions.
